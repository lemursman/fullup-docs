## Introducing Webhooks

Webhooks are now available on Fullup, offering a real-time data push mechanism that allows external applications to receive immediate updates from Fullup.

This means no more polling for updates. Instead, get instant notifications about events such as order status changes, new user registrations and inventory updates directly to your specified URL endpoint(s).

Webhooks are designed to help your business respond faster to changes, further streamlining operations and improving customer experiences.

## New API documentation site

To support the integration of webhooks and the use of our API, we're launching a comprehensive API documentation site.

This new resource is designed to be your go-to guide for understanding how to make the most of Fullup's APIs. It includes detailed documentation on webhook setup, event types, security practices, and much more.

Our goal is to provide clear, helpful content that empowers you to build seamless integrations.

## Upcoming expansions of our API suite

Looking ahead, we're excited to share that our API suite will soon expand to include a wide range of new functionalities.

These upcoming APIs will allow businesses to programmatically add users, create business locations, manage orders, and much more.

We're committed to providing a powerful set of tools that will open up new possibilities for automating and enhancing your rental business operations.

## Get Started Today

We invite you to explore the new webhook functionality and dive into our API documentation site to start building more dynamic, efficient, and integrated solutions.
