# Fullup APIs

As part of Fullup's expanding API ecosystem, webhooks are currently available to Fullup subscribers, providing a robust mechanism for real-time data synchronization and event-driven automation.

## The Role of Webhooks in Fullup's API Ecosystem

Webhooks are a critical component of Fullup's API ecosystem, designed to facilitate immediate communication between Fullup and external systems.

Unlike traditional APIs that require polling to check for updates, webhooks proactively push data to a specified URL endpoint in real-time when specific events occur. This enables businesses to automate responses to changes within Fullup, enhancing efficiency and responsiveness.

## Leveraging Webhooks for Business Automation

With webhooks, businesses can automate a wide range of processes, including:

- Instant order status updates
- Real-time inventory management
- Automated customer notifications
- Dynamic CRM updates

This immediate flow of information allows businesses to stay ahead, ensuring that their systems and operations are always in sync with the latest events and data from Fullup.

## Setting Up Webhooks with Fullup

Fullup alone radically improves automation for your rental business. If you want to extend automation to third party applications outside of Fullup, integrate Fullup webhooks into your operations.

1. Once signed in as an admin on your Fullup site, go to `Settings`, and click on `Webhooks` under `Integrations`.
1. Define a URL endpoint on your server to receive webhook data.
1. Provide the URL where Fullup should send events.
1. Configure the events (i.e. `scope`) that should trigger the webhook.

This setup enables your business to start receiving real-time data from Fullup without delay.

## Anticipating the Full API Suite

While webhooks offer significant value by themselves, they are just the beginning.

Fullup is actively developing a full API suite that will open up even more possibilities for businesses. This upcoming API will allow for comprehensive interactions with Fullup's platform, including adding users, creating business locations, managing orders, and much more.

The full API suite promises to provide a more integrated and seamless experience for businesses looking to leverage Fullup's capabilities.
